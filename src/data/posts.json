We’ve created a demo project that runs the <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com\" target=\"_blank\">Datadog agent</a>, allowing you to collect metrics about your hardware. You can integrate our example project with your existing setup to start capturing information about CPU utilization, disk,  and network usage, temperature etc. immediately.",
