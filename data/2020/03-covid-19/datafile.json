In just <a href='https://foldforcovid.io/'>a few simple steps</a>, you can add your devices and play your part in the fight against this global pandemic. <br><br><a href='https://foldforcovid.io/'>Fold for Covid</a> amplifies the incredible work already being done by Baker Lab, ARM, Packet, Neocortix, and Linaro. Find out more about the project and its origins in our <a href='https://www.balena.io/blog/balena-enables-more-devices-to-join-rosetta-home-to-research-covid-19/'>announcement post</a>."
