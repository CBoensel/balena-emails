Our team also got to the bottom of <a href='https://www.balena.io/blog/usb-issue-rca/' target='_blank'>USB temperature issues</a> on the Fin v1.1.<br><br>From the lab, we showed edge developers, hackers, and makers how to <a target='_blank' href='https://www.balena.io/blog/make-yourself-a-security-camera-system-in-30-minutes-or-less/'>build an IoT surveillance camera</a> in 30 minutes, and how to get started with <a target='_blank' href='https://www.balena.io/blog/tracking-bluetooth-beacons-with-a-raspberry-pi/'>BLE (Bluetooth low-energy) item trackers</a>. We learned how one balenista <a href='https://www.balena.io/blog/how-my-cat-helped-me-build-a-better-iot-app/' target='_blank'>improved their IoT app development process</a> using balena (to better spy on their cat).<br><br>As always, see highlight our favorite community projects of the month.
