It’s an important thing to get right at this point in balena’s journey; <strong>we’re making this change to unlock a whole host of other features in the future.</strong><br><br>Get all of the details about this change on our <a href='https://balena.io/blog/the-road-to-multi-app-transitioning-balenacloud-applications-to-fleets'>blog post</a>.<br><br>- Team balena"
