There is also a video tutorial of how to flash a Raspberry Pi and then add it to balena. The final piece that is included is a ready-made Dockerfile to get you started!

Upon receiving the GPS coordinates, he then sends them to an InfluxDB table and uses Grafana to visualize (plot) the coordinates over time.
